# Homebrew Cecil Formulae

This repository contains a [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) Formulae for installing [Cecil](https://github.com/Cecilapp/Cecil) on macOS.

## Usage

To install the lastest stable release of Cecil, just run the following command:

```bash
brew install cecilapp/tap/cecil
```

You can then run the `cecil` command from anywhere in the system:

```bash
cecil --version
```

If you need to install others versions of Cecil, first you need to _tap_ the repository:

```bash
brew tap cecilapp/tap
```

Then run one of the following commands:

```bash
brew install cecil
brew install cecil-7
brew install cecil-beta
```
